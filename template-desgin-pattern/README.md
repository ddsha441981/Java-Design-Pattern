# File Processing System Implementation

## Overview

This project introduces a robust **File Processing System** that follows the **Template Method Pattern**. It enables seamless and extensible file processing for various file types, ensuring secure and efficient handling. The system allows easy expansion by adding new file processors while maintaining a consistent processing flow.

---

## Core Features

- **Template Method Pattern**: Defines a standard processing flow with customizable steps for different file types.
- **File Type Support**: Processors for various file formats like text, CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, and PDF.
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamically routes file types to the appropriate processor.
- **REST API**: Exposes file processing functionality over HTTP with endpoints for uploading and listing supported file types.
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Uses Spring Boot for multipart file uploads and easy integration with web frameworks.

---

## Key Benefits

- **Consistent Flow**: Uniform file processing across different formats.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new file types by creating new processor classes.
- **Thread-Safe**: Uses thread-safe registry and routing for processors.
- **Clean Separation**: Separates concerns across Template, Factory, and Controller layers.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with structured logging.

## Concrete File Processors

We have concrete implementations for various file types:

- `TextFileProcessor` (.txt)
- `CsvFileProcessor` (.csv)
- `ExcelFileProcessor` (.xls, .xlsx)
- `JsonFileProcessor` (.json)
- `XmlFileProcessor` (.xml)
- `PdfFileProcessor` (.pdf)

Each processor overrides methods to handle its respective file type.

---

## Factory Design

A **FileProcessorFactory** is implemented for:

- Extension-based routing to the correct file processor based on the file type.
- A thread-safe processor registry for managing processor instances.
- Validation to ensure only supported file types are processed.

---

## REST API

### Endpoints

- **POST api/v1/file/operation?file**
  - Handles file uploads and processing.
  - Accepts `multipart/form-data` with the file to be processed.


### Spring Boot Configuration

The project is configured with Spring Boot for handling multipart file uploads:

- **Max file size** and **max request size** are configurable in `application.properties`.
- Temporary file storage location is set for processing large files efficiently.

---

## Configuration

### `application.properties`:

- `spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size`: Set the maximum file size for uploads.
- `spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size`: Set the maximum request size for file uploads.
- Temporary file storage paths can be configured for optimal performance.

---

## Security Considerations

- **File Size Limits**: Limits on file size to prevent large file uploads from causing issues.
- **Temporary File Cleanup**: Temporary files are automatically deleted after processing.
- **Input Validation**: Files are validated at the API layer before processing begins.

---

## ðŸ“ˆFuture Enhancements

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement async processing for large files.
- **Virus Scanning**: Integrate file scanning for viruses before processing.
- **Progress Tracking**: Provide feedback on processing progress via WebSocket or API endpoints.
- **Add asynchronous** file processing support (Spring Events or ExecutorService).
- **Add** file virus scanning integration (optional for high-security environments).
- **Expose** processing progress via WebSocket or REST API.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/template-desgin-pattern.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd template-desgin-pattern
    ```
3. Install dependencies and build the project:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
5. Access the API:
    - **POST** http://localhost:8181/api/v1/file/operation?file to upload and process files.

    - **GET** http://localhost:8181/api/v1/file/operation/supported-types to see supported file types.
âœ… Status

    This implementation is complete, tested, and production-ready for extensible file handling.
